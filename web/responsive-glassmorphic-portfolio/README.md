## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `src/index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

## Design Principles
- **Glassmorphism**: The design utilizes a glass-like effect achieved through CSS properties such as `backdrop-filter`, `box-shadow`, and `border-radius`.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries are implemented to ensure the website adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your browser supports the CSS properties used for the glassmorphic effect.
- Customize the styles in `style.css` and the functionality in `script.js` as needed to fit your design preferences.
